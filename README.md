# Procedure-wearable-data-standardization-Mobilise-D
Code to implement wearable data standardization and to access data standardized with the Mobilise-D procedure

Description
The available code is related to the submitted pubblication "Mobility recorded by wearable devices and gold standards: the Mobilise-D procedure for data standardization ", currently under review at Scientific Data.
The code allows to open and plot the standardized Matlab files shared on the corresponding Mobilise-d Zenodo repository by using Python (code in 'Python code for access' folder) and R (code in 'R code for access' folder). 
The 'utils' folder contains the code to open the standardized Matlab structure in Python, based on the github repository available at https://github.com/skjerns/mat7.3. 
The 'MATLAB code for standardization' folder contains code to standardize ICICLE dataset shared in the Mobilise-d Zenodo repository.
Further details can be found in the readme.txt file contained in each subfolder and in the publication.

How to run
Before running the code extract the 'Code' folder in the 'Example Subects Mobilise-D' directory that you can download from the Mobilise-d Zenodo repository.
